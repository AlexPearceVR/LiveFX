# Working with the Alpha Channel

The main tab that you should think of when you are using a file with an alpha channel, is the Fill/Matte tab on the bottom left.&#x20;

It may also help to start your project with a Filler, such as Black.&#x20;

After you've created a Filler layer and entered your project, you can now add your foreground elements, in this case, I'm adding a Noisy and De-Noised beauty pass. These both have alpha channels and by default, they are enabled, so the sky looks black.&#x20;

Now I drop in my environment pass on the top of the layer stack, so that it goes behind the other two files.&#x20;

Some times you may have an alpha channel off by default and you want to turn it on, such as this exr:

In the Fill/Matte menu, enable the alpha menu, and now the alpha channel will be active.
