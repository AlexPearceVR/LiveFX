# ðŸ“š Getting Started

Live FX offers a toolset for virtual production in its broadest sense: live on-set compositing, pre-visualization, and LED wall projection. It includes media and version management, metadata handling, and recording options and as such allows you to both easily prepare live setups in advance as well as create relevant input for post-production. \

It also integrates image-based lighting (IBL) through DMX allowing you full control over the look and feel of a scene.&#x20;
