# Change Shot Framerate and Resolution

When you create a shot, it inherits the Live Setup, the timeline default, or the imported clip's resolution and framerate.&#x20;

You can change your shot resolution and framerate by going into your shot, then to the Media tab on the bottom left and changing the resolution/frame rate on the right-hand side, under Image Format.

If your Resolution is greyed out, then you will need to go back to the construct. \
On the left side, change the Player Mode from "Single Shot" to "Timeline".&#x20;

Now you can change your Resolution here or inside your shot in the Media timeline.&#x20;

If you have multiple shots in your timeline, it will play all of them. If you want your shot to loop, you will need to put it on its own timeline, with no other shots.&#x20;
