# General Tips

This article will contain many general tips that we will use to link back to other areas of the documentation. It may also be helpful to just read each one individually.&#x20;

## Activate the Camera

Many effects require there to be an active camera in your scene, whether you need one or not. In many cases, you will not need to think about this because if you enable camera tracking and press apply, it will automatically activate the camera for you.&#x20;

To activate the camera manually, go to the Camera Menu at the bottom left and press the Active so that there is a solid Orange bar to the right of it.

## Add a Version

Add Version duplicates your shot and makes the duplicate your active shot.&#x20;

To add a version, open the right-side menu, go to the **Versions tab** and press **Add Version.**
