# Advanced

The last tab of the **Advanced Configuration** dialog, which you can open from the System Settings menu in the Startup module of Live FX, gives access to several specialized settings to modify certain aspects of Live FX. In normal circumstances, there is no need to modify these settings. Only for specific purposes and on the advice of Assimilate support, you should change these settings.

The Settings (referred to as "variables") are grouped in several categories: General, Graphics, Media, Remote, and IO. By default, all settings are shown grayed out - meaning that they are on their default value or not being used. When you select a specific setting the right pane of the dialog shows a brief description of the setting, a toggle to turn it ON or OFF, and possibly an additional control to set a specific value.

Again, please do not activate any setting/variable unless you know its purpose or have been told to do so by the Assimilate Support team, as it might directly impact Live FX behavior.
