# Introduction

Assimilate, Inc. has a long history of creating many different software applications for Hollywood workflows, such as Live FX for Color-Correction/Finishing and Play Pro Studio for playing back media on-set.&#x20;

Live FX is our software that is focused on Virtual Production solutions. \
\
Here are some examples of supported setups and workflows:

* Basic green-screen setup with 2D or 2.5D (equirectangular) background, using a camera tracker to position the background image.
* Green screen with active camera tracking and 3D backgrounds coming from Unreal, Unity, Notch, or internal USD renderer.
* LED wall projection of 2D, 2.5D or 3D media on any LED wall configuration: single wall, multiple walls, curved walls. In a colour-managed context and can graded with the full set of grading controls.
* A pure keyer solution for other applications – using all layering-, masking- and plug-in tools available and sending the result as separate RGB and Alpha Video IO channels or NDI.
* Image-Based Lighting (IBL) – easy setup of fixture configuration, sampling color-managed images, and sending over ArtNet or sACN.
* Record live composites on-set for instant review without the need for offloading cards from the camera(s). Capture all camera tracking and other dynamic metadata in a sidecar file for post-production/VFX usage.
* Animate the virtual camera and use the Unreal or Unity plug-in to directly control the camera in the renderer, capture the rendered output directly from the GPU without delay for your composite, grade, and (optionally) record the result.

Live FX exposes live camera tracking, live links, and other dynamic metadata in a way that allows compositors, VFX specialists, and DITs to work with it in a familiar creative context rather than in a programming style environment.

Live FX is an application within the Assimilate Product Suite installer and can be combined with other Assimilate product licenses.

This part of the user guide covers the Live FX-specific functions and tools. General functions of the Assimilate Product Suite, such as creating a new project, playback features, or grading tools are covered in the generic section/chapters of the product suite user guide. It is recommended to also read that manual or view the various available tutorial videos.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Live FX comes in two flavors: Live FX Studio and Live FX. Certain functions are only available in Live FX studio. In that case, the manual will state ‘FX Studio’ only. See the [feature-comparison.md](feature-comparison.md "mention") page for more details.
