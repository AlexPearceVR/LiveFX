## How to ping a device on the network

If you are trying to connect to a network, you can use the ping command to troubleshoot if the computer can talk to the device you are trying to connect to.&#x20;

1. (Windows) Click on Windows and search for Command Prompt. \
   (Mac) Search Applications for Terminal.
2.  Type in "ping" then the address you want to ping, with a space between ping and the address. For example I would enter "ping 192.168.1.1"\
    \
    If the ping is successful, it will show a number and **bytes** from the address like in this screenshot:\

    If the ping is unsuccessful, it will say **Request timeout**.\
