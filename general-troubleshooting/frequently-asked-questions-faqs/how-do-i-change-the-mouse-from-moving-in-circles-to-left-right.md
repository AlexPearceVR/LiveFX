# How do I change the mouse from moving in circles to left/right?

By default, Live FX is set up so that to move towards a positive value, you click on the number and move your mouse in a clockwise motion, and to go in a negative direction, you click and move your mouse in a counter-clockwise motion.&#x20;

Here's how you can change your default to a more common way, similar to sliders:

1. Open Assimilate an go to the main screen.
2.  At the bottom left, click on User Settings\
