The concepts for 2.5d are very similar to Cuebric, with a little more manual work involved. See the section on Cuebric for more.&#x20;

The 2.5d concept is pretty simple, you have several 2d layers of pictures or videos as separate layers and you put them in various depths of your scene so that as you move your camera, they create a parallax effect, such that the foreground elements appear to move faster than the background elements.&#x20;

If done well, you can make 2d elements look like 3d.&#x20;

You can even combine some 3d elements with 2d elements as well, but this section will focus on 2d elements for now.&#x20;
