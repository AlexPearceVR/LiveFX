# Non-Projection Mapping 2.5d Workflow

You can manually set up a 2.5d shot by adding in layers and putting them in various Z-depth spaces, or project them on planes a varying depths. &#x20;

1. [Set your shot resolution](../getting-started/the-basics/change-shot-framerate-and-resolution.md) to the same resolution as your LED wall, or your preferred output resolution if Green Screen.&#x20;
2.  Add a Filler to the timeline and enter the shot.\

3.  If you want to increase the shot duration, go to the Live FX Menu and change the out number to something longer, like 1000 frames. \

4.  Right-click and import your files one at a time, you may want to click on "Still Frame" if you are importing images.\

5.  After you add all your images, you can Shift+select them and Press Group. The order should go further back layer on top and closest layer on the bottom. Then with the Group selected, you may need to go to the Canvas menu and scale to fit.\

    Now that your layers are set up, you can now just follow the instructions for [Cuebric Working with Layers](../cuebric-workflow/non-projection-mapping-with-cuebric.md#working-with-the-layers).
