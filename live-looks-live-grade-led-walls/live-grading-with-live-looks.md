# Live Grading with Live Looks

After you have set up Live Looks to work with your LED Processor, you can switch to the Color FX workspace at the bottom of the application.

You can choose to grade from many different workspaces&#x20;

You do not have a live image coming into your machine with this workflow, rather you load in a reference image or use one of the few included ones as your reference.&#x20;

In the example below, the colorist is in the Curves window, and using Hue-Sat to desaturate all skin tones, and over-saturate the blues, and you can see the grade applied (left) vs unaffected reference image (right)&#x20;

Most of the effects will not be applied to the wall.&#x20;

### LUT-based to CDL-based

{% hint style="info" %}
On the Project Tab, you can change the Color mode from LUT-based to CDL, if you using a Megapixel HELIOS processor which doesn't support 3D  LUTs as of this article.
