# ðŸŒ… Live Looks - Live Grade LED Walls

## Overview

Live Looks is a different software than Live FX that allows you to live-grade an LED volume by connecting to the LED processor and applying a 3d LUT in real-time, turning the processor into a LUT box.&#x20;

The setup is very easy and is non-destructive as you can always just turn off the 3d LUT on the LED processor.

This works with Mac or PC and just requires a network conn

Currently, Live Looks is fully integrated into Brompton processors, with Megapixel and Nova Star in development.

With Megapixel, you can currently export the LUT from Live Looks and manually update it to the HELIOS software, until the full live integration is finished.\

## Using Live Looks in tandem with Live FX

You do not need to be driving the LED wall with Live FX for Live Looks to work.

If you are using Live FX to drive the wall, you can use the color tools built into Live FX to do all colors in Live FX, but sometimes it is preferred to have a separate machine that handles the global color correction for the LED wall.

In this case, you would run Live Looks on a separate machine than Live FX, which works well for most productions where you may want to give powerful color correction tools to an on-set colorist or DIT and have that on a separate machine from your media server software (in this case Live FX).

You can also use Live Looks as your camera calibration software, where you could put medium grey on the wall, white balance, and create a display LUT, that you can leave on the LED processor.
