# Why won't Live FX open when I have a second monitor hooked up?

On Windows, if you have a second monitor (or LED Processor) hooked up, sometimes Live FX won't open due to a process called Nahimic. **You must end this process and restart Assimilate**.&#x20;

1.  Go to the **Task Manager**, either by pressing Control+Alt+Delete or by searching the Windows menu for Task Manager.&#x20;

2.  Look for any processes with "**Nahimic**" in the name and **End Task** for all of them.&#x20;

3. If Assimilate is still stalling, you may need to **End Task for Assimilate** as well.&#x20;
4. **Restart Assimilate**.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may need to end Nahimic several times before it goes away. \
Also, you may have to do this every time you restart the PC. \
\
Note: You do not need Nahimic for any other software or for any reason.
