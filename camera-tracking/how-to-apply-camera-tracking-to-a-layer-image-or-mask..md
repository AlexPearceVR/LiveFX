# How to apply camera tracking to a layer, image, or mask.

1. Select the layer that you want to apply the camera tracking to.
2. Go to the **Canvas menu** at the bottom left.
3. De-select **Relative.**
4. Adjust the Scale and Trans x,y, and z until your image or mask is in the correct area.

Notice in the screenshot below the scale is almost 1000x. \

You may need to exaggerate the scale and move the layer in Z depth for it to work properly with your camera tracking.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
