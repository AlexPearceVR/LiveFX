# How to manually adjust camera tracking speed and delay

Sometimes, for one reason or the other, you need to be able to adjust the camera tracking speed or delay.&#x20;

There are two main areas to make adjustments.&#x20;

## Live Links

The Live Links menu. Go to Live FX Menu, then Live Links and pull up the camera tracker you want to adjust, in this example, Ncam.

Here you adjust a few things mostly related to delaying or smoothing the tracking data coming into your machine.&#x20;

## Animate

For more advanced adjustments, you can navigate to the **Animate** button above the Live FX menu and select the **Live Links** tab.

Then select the parameters you want to adjust and make your adjustments.&#x20;

Let's look at a few examples.&#x20;

### Slow down the pan

If you pan your camera and the background moves too fast, you can slow down the pan by changing the factor of the pan.&#x20;

1. Select the **Pan** parameter.
2. Change from **Absolute to Factor**.
3. &#x20;Set the **factor** to something less than 1.&#x20;

In this example, I've set my pan to be a factor of .5, or half pan speed.

Now pan your camera. If it's too slow, go up to .75 and try again.&#x20;

Keep repeating this process until your pan speed looks correct.

### Invert Tilt

In this example, let's say when you tilt up, the virtual camera tilts down. Here's how you could manually change this.&#x20;

1. Select the Tilt parameter.
2. Change Absolute to Invert.
