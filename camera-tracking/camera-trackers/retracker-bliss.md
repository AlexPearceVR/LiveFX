# REtracker Bliss

Here is a tutorial for how to set up the REtracker BLISS to work with Assimilate Live FX:

These instructions will be changing because Assimilate will implement the REtracker into the list of Camera Trackers soon.

1. Open RETracker BLISS Settings.
2. Enable FreeD, disable Livelinkbliss, and Tag Tracking.&#x20;
3.  If on your local machine, use 127.0.0.1 for the Renderer IP. Whatever you set the port to here, you'll need to match in Live FX.\

4. Launch REtracker BLISS
5. In Assimilate, go to the Live FX Menu then Live Links
6.  Turn **FreeD Tracker** On and set the port to the same number you had in the settings, in my case 40000.\

7. Follow the [Camera Calibration and Nodal Offset instructions](../camera-and-lens-calibration.md), to get the correct nodal offset.&#x20;
