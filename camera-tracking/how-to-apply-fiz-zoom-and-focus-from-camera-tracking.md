# How to apply FIZ (Zoom and Focus) from Camera Tracking

## Overview

By default, Live FX does not enable FIZ (Focus, Iris, Zoom) from your camera tracking system.

Some Camera Trackers, such as Ncam and Stype, have their own FIZ encoders and Live FX can bring in some of that data.&#x20;

Let's look at how to enable Focus and Zoom.

1. First, go to **Animate**.
2. Click on the **Live Links** Tab.

3. Click on Focal Length **(Zoom)** and Focus Distance **(Focus)**
4.  If you have a camera tracker enabled, click on **Live Source** and change it to the appropriate parameter from your tracker. \

    _In this screenshot, I do not have any tracker enabled, so I don't have a Live Source to change it to._\
