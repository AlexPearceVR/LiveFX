# Sync Players

Sync Players is a way to synchronize two or more machines playhead position. The two machines don't have to be in the same project or even have any of the same settings, it just simply looks at the master node and syncs the playhead to that position.&#x20;

This can be great for synchronized content but also can be used creatively. For example, you could have a completely different piece of content that plays back on your client machine.&#x20;

## Setup

1. Make sure the machines are on the same network and can ping each other.
2.  On the Master machine, enter the shot you want to use and go at the top-right of the viewport. Click on Tools>Sync Players.\
