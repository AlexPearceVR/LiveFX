# üñ•Ô∏è Multi-Computer Workflows

A few important things to note.&#x20;

While the multi-computer workflow can be synchronized, the client machines are usually 1-3 frames behind the master machine. This may be acceptable for workflows where one machine drives the wall and one machine drives a ceiling, but may not be acceptable for a continuous wall.&#x20;

If the content itself is static, you may not notice the delay, but if you have dynamic content, like a driving plate, then you will likely see a delay between the two continuous sections.&#x20;
