These include two .2p5d files, as well as those same files, unzipped.&#x20;

## Defocus Layers

One benefit to having separate layers for the foreground, middle ground, and background is that you can color grade and defocus the layers individually. You can defocus the far background and extreme foreground and get a more realistic-looking image. This is useful no matter which workflow you are using.

To defocus layers, select the layer you want to affect, go to the **Numeric tab,** and under Aperture, change the Defocus. I'll defocus the Sky, Water, Mountains and Rocks layers.

You could also use the Lens Blur plug-in to get more extreme results.&#x20;

Go to Plug-ins->Effects->Lens Blur and add on layer.

Make any adjustments you want here, and make sure to Blur Alpha.

## Greenscreen / non-projection mapping .2p5d files

For non-projection mapping workflows.&#x20;

#### Set up the .2p5d shot

1. Create a new timeline, and set your timeline resolution to whatever you want your final resolution to be, in this example, i'll use 1920x1080.
2.  From the Construct, click on the Import Clips button in the middle of the screen and navigate to the .2p5d file.\

3.  Click on the Reload Project at the bottom left of the construct. **If you don't do this, your media may not load correctly and when you enter your shot, it may just be black.** \


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


4. Enter the shot by double-clicking the shot. [Change the Shot Length](getting-started/the-basics/change-the-shot-length.md) if you want to.&#x20;

#### Rename the layers

Let's [rename the layers](getting-started/the-basics/working-with-layers.md#rename-layers) so that instead of Image\_5, we know what we are working with.&#x20;

#### Working with the layers

It helps to visualize what is happening with the layers, to do that we can enter Dual View \[Shortcut D] and one of the views to be Perspective View \[Shortcut P]. You can toggle between these views by using the shortcuts.&#x20;

I like to Unlink the views by clicking on Link on the right side so that it is grey. Now i can fit the image on the right side, and zoom out to see what is happening in our scene on the left.&#x20;

Notice that Image\_1 is selected and the orange line corresponds to where that is in 3d space. If I were to move it in Trans Z we'd see it update here.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The main ways to increase/decrease the parallax effect are by moving the images closer/further away from the camera in Z space and by moving the camera.&#x20;

To move the individual layers, click on a layer, then click on the **Canvas Menu.**

As we change the Trans X, Y, Z, or Scale, we will see it updated in the Perspective view.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If we move our camera on the X-axis right now, we can see the bottom of the Dome layer is floating, and the far background (Sky, Water, and Mountains) is moving way too much.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (216).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If we think about real-life parallax, the sky and water are so far away we wouldn't notice any parallax by moving a few feet one way or the other and the mountains would just barely be noticeable, so let's try to create that effect.

1.  We need to change the camera Far clipping plane, otherwise, we'll move our layer back behind the clipping plane and it will just turn black. To do that, go to the Camera Tab, click on the Config tab, and change the Far distance to something very far, I'll set it to 10,000 for now. \


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (220).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


2.  Now let's move our Sky layer and Water layer very far back, I'll set -5000 on the Trans Z. Make sure Fit is enabled and/or scale it to fit the screen. \


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (221).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


3.  For the Mountains layer, move it back in Trans Z, check the camera, and repeat that until you are happy with the results. In my case, I found that -250 on Trans Z looks natural.\


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (222).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


4.  For the Dome layer, the parallax looks good, but the layer itself is floating above, so click on the layer and move it, or use the canvas menu Trans X and Trans Y to move it into a position that works. \
    \
    **Tip** - With the layer selected, you can move your cursor right over one of the edges of the layer, hold Shift, and click and drag to scale the layer uniformly.\


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (223).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


5. Lastly, defocus and color each layer as needed and you are ready to shoot!

## Projection-Mapping with .2p5d Files



#### Projection Setup

1. Open the Projection Setup menu
2. For Project Media, browse to the .2p5d file.
3. Under Media Type, choose 2.5d
4.  For projection, we recommend the Planar Projection.\


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


5.  Make sure that the resolution of your shot is the same as the resolution of your Wall. For example, in my case, it's 4000x1600, but I had accidentally set my timeline to be 1920x1080, so I checked when I entered my shot, and then went back to Single Shot so that it would enter the shot at the correct resolution. \


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The bottom right of the shot always tells you the resolution and frame rate.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Working with Projection Mapping

It helps to see what is happening by going to the Live FX menu, Stage Manager. Here you can see the position of the camera, the position of the LED wall, and the position of each layer in Z space.&#x20;

Projection mapping 2.5d workflows work similarly to non-projection mapping, but in the viewport, it will look the opposite of what you would imagine should be happening; the closest layers will move less than the further layers.

{% hint style="info" %}
You should look at your physical wall or through the stage manager to check if the parallax looks correct and if everything is working properly. Looking at the image in the editor can be deceiving because it's based on what the camera would be seeing through the projection.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Yellow planes here are the various layers set to different depths. </p></figcaption></figure>

When you enter your shot, you will need to adjust a few things. You might notice that it's black or that it doesn't fill your entire wall, for example. There are two main ways of adjusting the size and depth of your individual layers. These are the Camera position and Plane->Wall Projection Settings for each layer.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>How my shot looked when i first entered. The content should fill all the way to the white thin border.</p></figcaption></figure>

Move your camera to your filming position. I moved my camera back, and already it's closer to what i need it to be, notice in the screenshot below that as I moved my Z position back, it started filling the frame better.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With your camera in the correct position, it's time to adjust the individual layers to work better for us. First, I will rename my images, so I know what they are.&#x20;

Image\_5 was just a cloud image for the ceiling, which I don't have so I'll just delete it.&#x20;

Select the sky layer, and open the Plane->Wall menu on the bottom left.&#x20;

The two main things we will need to adjust throughout this process are the **Trans Z** and the **Width/Height** (linked).&#x20;

**Trans Z** pushes the layer further away from the camera the lower the number goes, or closer to the camera the higher the number goes.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not see the image, you may be actually behind your camera, adjust your layers back or move the Z position of your camera back to line it up.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Width/Height** scales the image up or down.&#x20;

Go through each layer and change the Width/Height, Trans Z, and position them in X,Y space where you want them.&#x20;

## Manually set up 2.5d layers

You can manually set up a 2.5d shot by adding in layers and putting them in various Z-depth spaces, or project them on planes a varying depths. &#x20;

1. [Set your shot resolution](getting-started/the-basics/change-shot-framerate-and-resolution.md) to the same resolution as your LED wall, or your preferred output resolution if Green Screen.&#x20;
2.  Add a Filler to the timeline and enter the shot.

    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (211).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


3.  If you want to increase the shot duration, go to the Live FX Menu and change the out number to something longer, like 1000 frames. \


    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (214).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4.  Right-click and import your files one at a time, you may want to click on "Still Frame" if you are importing images.

    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (212).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


5.  After you add all your images, you can Shift+select them and Press Group. The order should go further back layer on top and closest layer on the bottom. Then with the Group selected, you may need to go to the Canvas menu and scale to fit.\
