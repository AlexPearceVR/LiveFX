# Speed up and Slow Down Footage

If you want to speed up or slow down video content, you can use the "Re-Timer" Plug-in.\


It works slightly different, depending on what you are doing, there are you options:



{% content-ref url="re-time-footage-with-projection-mapping.md" %}
[re-time-footage-with-projection-mapping.md](re-time-footage-with-projection-mapping.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="re-time-footage-on-a-canvas.md" %}
[re-time-footage-on-a-canvas.md](re-time-footage-on-a-canvas.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="re-time-footage-on-a-file.md" %}
[re-time-footage-on-a-file.md](re-time-footage-on-a-file.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
