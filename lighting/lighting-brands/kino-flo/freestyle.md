Use Profile 18. \

If you have more than one Freestyle hooked up, use channel 001 for one of them and you can use 0012 for the next one.&#x20;

Using Profile 18 on the lights.&#x20;

For some reason I had to start the universe on 2. I thought maybe it was because the DMX number on the KinoFlo started at 1, and maybe it wasn’t accounting for 0, but changing it didn’t work, so I don’t know what the issue was.
