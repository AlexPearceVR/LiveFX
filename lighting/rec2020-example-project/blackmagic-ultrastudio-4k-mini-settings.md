# Blackmagic UltraStudio 4k Mini Settings

{% hint style="danger" %}
We have seen a bug with the UltraStudio 4k mini, that would cause color shifting in the Kino Flo Mimik. \
\
We were able to fix it by cycling from "Keep default color gamut", to "Convert to Rec. 2020" and then back to what it should be; "Keep default color gamut".&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The settings are in the screenshots below, here are the main ones to keep in mind.&#x20;
