# Fix Jitter

You might have some jitter if your UI monitor and your external monitors are not in sync.&#x20;

On Windows, there are ways you can genlock the editor monitor with the LED monitor. \
\
On Mac, you cannot do this, but you can at least set your frequency to be a multiple of the frame rate you are sending, and this can help.

To do this, go to System Settings > Displays.

On older operating systems, you need to hold down the Option key and click on Scaled to get the advanced options to change the refresh rate. Select 48 Hertz (if you are working and sending a 24fps signal).&#x20;

In newer operating systems, you do not need to hold down the option key to see refresh rate options.
