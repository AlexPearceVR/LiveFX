Here you should set your UltraStudio 4k Mini to 1080p24.

\
Format: YUV 10/422

REC2020 Video

Input should be set to Rec709 Full (This is given to you by the brain bar or the camera, normally this is likely Rec709 Video, but in this case, it's Rec709 Full)

For the Output, if set to default it will inherit the settings on the right side of the menu, but you can also override this. It doesn't hurt to also set it to Rec202 Video.

While you are here, you should make sure any Video IO settings that are not used are turned off.&#x20;

Specifically, make sure NDI is turned off unless you are actively using it.
