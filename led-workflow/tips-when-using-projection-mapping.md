# Tips when using Projection Mapping

## Create a still image from your Unreal Engine Project

There is a feature called "Use Foreground Still that is found in the Frustum to Wall and Planar to Wall plugins.

If you created your projection from the main menu, you may need to go into the Node Tree and select the Outer Frustum node, then select the Frustum->Wall or Planar->Wall Menu, select the Background tab, and then click on **Use Foreground Still**
