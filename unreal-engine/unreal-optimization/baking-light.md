# Baking Light

Light baking is an excellent way to improve performance, but it is somewhat of a balancing act to make everything work correctly. Here are a few tips up front:

* Use GPU Lightmass Plugin
* If you have moveable objects in your scene, set them to movable and lighting to stationary (not static)
